# A simple game in Java 
My very fist and simple game programmed in Java

## Description 
In this game, there are two different types of character: people and virus. The player can choose to be a person or a virus. All people and virus will move randomly in the game board. When a person comes into contact with the virus, the person and the virus then stop moving and this person is considered infected.
The player can also choose the numbers of enermy at the begining of the game. The number of people and the number of viruses are always equal (excluding the player's character). 

Player tasks:
- if choose being a person: keep moving and dodging the virus. The player wins when there is no virus moving and loses when infected.
- if choose being a virus: try to infect everyone. The player wins when everyone has been infected.
